use absolute imports (using "~/folder") over relative imports

```diff
- import { activeDocuments } from "../store/whiteboard";
+ import { activeDocuments } from "~/src/store/whiteboard";
```

We require file extensions which always result in Typescript (`.ts`) files having Javascript (`.js`) extensions, so ensure your filesystem searches use `.ts` rather than `.js`.
