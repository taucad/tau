# Package Installation
Always use PNPM for installing packages with format pnpm install <package> (-d)
e.g.: 
- Production package: `pnpm install react`
- Development package: `pnpm install -d eslint`

**Exception**: When installing PRODUCTION packages specifically for projects located under the `packages/` directory, install the package directly in that project's directory instead of the workspace root.

Examples:
- General workspace dependency: `pnpm install react` (installs in workspace root)
- Package-specific dependency: `cd packages/converter && pnpm install lodash` (installs in packages/converter/)

# Testing Changes
As you iterate towards a solution, you should test your changes using NX workspace commands.
All commands follow the patter of `pnpm nx <command> <project> <options>`.

Possible commands:
- `typecheck` - Typecheck the project
- `test` - Test the project. Always use the `--watch=false` option.
  - Run tests for a specific file: `pnpm nx test <project> <path-from-PROJECT-root> --watch=false`
    - e.g. `pnpm nx test ui ./app/utils/crypto.test.ts --watch=false`
  - Run tests for a specific test name: `pnpm nx test <project> --testNamePattern=<test-name>`
    - e.g. `pnpm nx test converter --testNamePattern="should parse IFC file"`
- `lint` - Lint the project
  - Run lint for a specific file: `pnpm eslint <path-from-WORKSPACE-root>`
  - e.g. `pnpm eslint ./apps/ui/app/utils/crypto.test.ts`
- `build` - Build the project

The project is the name of the project you are working on, as designated by the path. For example, changes under `apps/ui` correspond to the `ui` project, whilst changes under `packages/converter` correspond to the `converter` project.

A full example to test the `ui` project would be `pnpm nx test ui`.
