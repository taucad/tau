# Package Installation
Always use PNPM for installing packages with format pnpm install <package> (-d)
e.g.: 
- Production package: `pnpm install react`
- Development package: `pnpm install -d eslint`

# Testing Changes
As you iterate towards a solution, you should test your changes using NX workspace commands.
All commands follow the patter of `pnpm nx <command> <application/package/lib> <options>`.

Possible commands:
- `typecheck` - Typecheck the application/package/lib
- `test` - Test the application/package/lib. Always use the `--watch=false` option.
- `lint` - Lint the application/package/lib
- `build` - Build the application/package/lib

The application/package/lib is the name of the application/package/lib you are working on, as designated by the path. For example, changes under `apps/ui` correspond to the `ui` application, whilst changes under `packages/converter` correspond to the `converter` package.

A full example to test the `ui` application would be `pnpm nx test ui`.
