/**
 * R9 (home page loading audit): a load of Home is steady from its first frame. The target frame sequence's
 * acceptance, held at 1x and 4x CPU for a fresh visitor and for a returning one with projects and a stored model:
 *
 * - no `layout-shift` entry from navigation start, other than one an input caused (CLS 0, not "good");
 * - no frame with the skills notice or its retry control, since nothing failed;
 * - no frame where the composer's model trigger prints a catalog id or nothing — in the server HTML and after
 *   hydration; a fixed-width placeholder is allowed until the catalog names the model;
 * - no frame with a loading spinner inside the application shell;
 * - no frame where the composer's box, border, outline or shadow differs from the settled page.
 *
 * A recorder installed before any page script samples every animation frame, so a state that is painted once
 * is caught; the server HTML is fetched and inspected on its own, before any script could have corrected it.
 * No API runs here: the page's model catalog is the API's real rows, served by the fixture a second late, while
 * the UI server's own catalog prefetch finds no API, which is the path a cold or failed prefetch takes.
