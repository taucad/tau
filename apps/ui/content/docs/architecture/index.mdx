# Architecture Overview

Learn about the technical implementation behind Tau's AI-powered CAD platform.

## Key Components

### [RAG System](./rag)
Complete implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that enhances the CAD assistant with intelligent API documentation retrieval.

**Key Benefits:**
- ~40% reduction in token usage per prompt
- ~60% fewer API mistakes and correction cycles
- ~2.5x better token/quality ratio

### [AI Evaluation Standards](./evaluation)
Evaluation metrics and standards for CAD-AI systems, including benchmark metrics for geometry generation, intent matching, and code quality.

**Benchmark Targets:**
- ≥ 99% kernel success rate
- ≥ 90% parametric robustness
- ≤ 2,000 prompt tokens per turn
