## Features

- **Multi-Kernel Support**: Work with Replicad, OpenSCAD, and Zoo (KCL) kernels
- **AI-Powered**: Intelligent CAD model generation with RAG-enhanced assistance  
- **Web-Based**: Browser-based CAD modeling with real-time collaboration
- **Export Capabilities**: Support for STL, STEP, and other CAD formats

## Getting Started

Choose your preferred CAD kernel and start building:

- [Replicad](./kernels/replicad) - Parametric TypeScript/JavaScript API backed by OpenCascade.js
- [OpenSCAD](./kernels/openscad) - WebAssembly build of OpenSCAD with `.scad` syntax
- [Zoo (KCL)](./kernels/zoo) - KittyCAD Language for cloud-native CAD with AI integration

## Architecture

Learn about the technical implementation:

- [RAG System](./architecture/rag) - How intelligent API documentation retrieval works
- [AI Evaluation](./architecture/evaluation) - Standards for CAD-AI prompt engineering
